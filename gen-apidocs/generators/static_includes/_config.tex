\section{CONFIG \& STORAGE}

Config and Storage resources are responsible for injecting data into your
applications and persisting data externally to your container.

Common resource types:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{#configmap-v1-core}{ConfigMap} for providing text key value pairs
        injected into the application through environment variables, command line arguments, or files
  \item \href{#secret-v1-core}{Secret} for providing binary data injected into the application through files
  \item \href{#volume-v1-core}{Volume} for providing a filesystem external to the Container.
        Maybe shared across Containers within the same Pod and have a lifetime
        persisting beyond a Container or Pod.
\end{itemize}
